## ⚠️ Issues Encountered

### React Native CLI Version

#### Critical Issues:
1. **React Native 0.82.0 is unstable**
   - Autolinking failures
   - `packageName` not found errors
   - Gradle plugin compatibility issues

2. **Build Errors:**
   ```
   RNGP - Autolinking: Could not find project.android.packageName
   ```

3. **MinSDK Mismatch:**
   - Required: 24
   - Original: 21
   - Fixed but requires native code changes

4. **Vision Camera Issues:**
   - MinSDK requirements
   - Hermes tooling errors
   - CMake configuration problems

#### What Was Attempted:
- ✅ Fixed `minSdkVersion` from 21 to 24
- ✅ Fixed duplicate `compileSdk` declarations
- ✅ Simplified `react-native.config.js`
- ✅ Added package name configuration
- ✅ Fixed signing config
- ❌ Autolinking still failed (RN 0.82 bug)

### Expo Version

#### Issues:
- ✅ None! Everything works out of the box

## 📊 Development Experience

### Time to First Run

| Phase | React Native CLI | Expo |
|-------|-----------------|------|
| Environment Setup | 1-2 hours | 0 minutes |
| Project Setup | 30 minutes | 2 minutes |
| Fix Build Issues | 2-3 hours | 0 minutes |
| First Run | 4-6 hours total | 5-10 minutes total |

### Testing Workflow

**React Native CLI:**
1. Write code
2. Run build command
3. Wait 3-5 minutes
4. Deploy to emulator/device
5. Test
6. Repeat

**Expo:**
1. Write code
2. Save file (hot reload)
3. Test immediately
4. Repeat

## 🏗️ Building for Production

### Android APK

**React Native CLI:**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
# Configure signing
# Generate keystore
# Update gradle config
```
⏱️ 15-20 minutes setup + build time

**Expo:**
```bash
eas build --platform android
```
⏱️ 5 minutes setup + build time

### iOS IPA

**React Native CLI:**
```bash
# Requires Mac
# Requires Apple Developer Account ($99/year)
# Configure Xcode
# Configure signing
# Archive and upload
```
⏱️ 30-60 minutes

**Expo:**
```bash
eas build --platform ios
# Expo handles most complexity
```
⏱️ 10-15 minutes

## 🎯 Use Case Recommendations

### Choose React Native CLI When:
- You need specific native modules not available in Expo
- You need maximum control over native code
- App size is critical
- You have experienced native developers
- You need custom native modules

### Choose Expo When:
- Rapid prototyping
- Quick delivery needed
- Limited native development experience
- Cross-platform is priority
- Easy testing/sharing is important
- OTA updates are valuable
- **This project** ✅

```bash
expo eject
# Creates native folders
# Now full React Native CLI project
```
✅ Can migrate if outgrow Expo

**RN CLI → Expo:**
- Requires rewrite
- Not straightforward
- Better to start with Expo

### Long-term Maintenance
